A Electronic voting machine that can be used to make Elections, referendum, and polls more secure, reliable, and transparent.

#idea for codefundoo++


-Online Election System would have Candidate registration, document verification, auto-generated User ID and pass for candidate and Voters. Password would be properly hashed and stored in database so that no one can access it.


-There would be an Admin Panel and Voters Panel. Admin login will be handled by Election Commission. Voters Login will be handled By Candidates, Voters who will get Unique ID and Password, using which they can vote for a Candidate only once per Election.

-Voters dashboard will have all the information and background related to the Elections and Candidates background. Admin dashboard has overall functional rights to remove voters or candidates not abiding rules and also add 18+ voters. Voters as soon as they turn 18+ they can apply for voting rights by registering with proper documents which will be crosschecked by admin and add him/her to voters list.

-The software system allows the Candidate to login in to their profiles and upload all their details including their previous milestone onto the system. The admin can check each Candidate details and verify the documents.

-After the election is completed, within few seconds the results will be generated and will be available in Admins dashboard as well as Voters dashboard.

-Basically I will be using CodeIgniter PHP Framework for handling the Admin and Voters Panel and Php MySql database for storing all the information related to voters and candidates.

-I will also be using the Open Government Data Platform India datasets for election related informations
